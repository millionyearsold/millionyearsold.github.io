<h1>Welcome to Lego Adelphi</h1>
<p>
    Here you will find (hopefully) useful instructions and guidance for building the Lego Adelphi.
</p>
<p>
    The Lego Adelphi is a small representation of the real building in London but made from about 980 pieces
    of lego instead of traditional construction materials. There are many benefits to using lego including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lego is relatively inexpensive</li>
    <li>It's small and so easily transportable</li>
    <li>Construction time is significantly reduced</li>
    <li>There's no shortage of skilled labour</li>
    <li>Lego buildings have a low eco footprint</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <i>Please note that there is a slight excess of building materials included with your package. This is
    to allow for even more artistic license and contingency (e.g. in the event that additional stability
        is required due to lack of structural integrity).</i>
</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Step by step instructions provide the most detailed web based Lego Adelphi building guidance but there are some limitations.
    Most notably transparent building materials are invisible in the item list for each page. Another curiosity is
    that building process is not the same as was used during the design phase. It's possible that this could make
    some of the components more difficult to complete - particularly internal components in the latter stages of the
    build.

</ul>
<h2>Visual Guide</h2>
<p>
    The visual guide is a series of images showing the Lego Adelphi in various stages of design from start
    to finish. It is intended to complement the step-by-step instructions. Be aware that there was a system outage
    on the 8th/9th floor video screen representation during the design phase. This has been rectified for the building
    phase - the video screen now shows the latest fashion news.

<h2>Design Guide</h2>
<p>
    The design guide utilizes the <a href="http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/download/">Lego Digital Designer application</a>
    which is available for Mac and Windows. It is the best tool for understanding how to build Lego Adelphi but
    requires a PC of some sort. If using the Lego Digital Designer be sure to select <i>"Building Guide Mode"</i>
    (top right button - or F7). Note that like the step-by-step instructions the building process is not quite the
    same as that followed during the design phase and so that might make some components more challenging during the build.

    <b>Warning:</b> the Lego Adelphi has not been designed to comply with building regulations. There have been no surveys.
    The HSE has not been consulted or even informed (and as far as we know they are completely unaware of the existence
    of the Lego Adelphi).
