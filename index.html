<h1>Welcome to Lego Adelphi</h1>
<p>
    Here you will find (hopefully) useful instructions and guidance for building the Lego Adelphi.
</p>
<p>
    The Lego Adelphi is a small representation of the real building in London but made from about 980 pieces
    of lego instead of traditional<br/> construction materials. There are many benefits to using lego including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lego is relatively inexpensive</li>
    <li>It's small and so easily transportable</li>
    <li>Construction time is significantly reduced</li>
    <li>There's no shortage of skilled labour</li>
    <li>Lego buildings have a low eco footprint</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <i>Please note that there is a slight excess of building materials included with your package. This is
    to allow for even more artistic license<br/>  and contingency (e.g. in the event that additional stability
        is required due to lack of structural integrity).</i>
</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Step by step instructions provide the most detailed web based Lego Adelphi building guidance but there are some limitations.
    Most notably transparent<br/> building materials are invisible in the item list for each page. Another curiosity is
    that building process is not the same<br/>as was used during the design phase. It's possible that this could make
    some of the components more difficult<br/>to complete - particularly internal components in the latter stages of the
    build.

<h2>Visual Guide</h2>
<p>
    The visual guide is a series of images showing the Lego Adelphi in various stages of design from start
    to finish. It is intended to complement the step-by-step instructions. Be aware that there was a system outage
    on the 8th/9th floor video screen representation during design phase. This has been rectified for the building
    phase - the video screen now shows the latest fashion news.

<p>
    <b>Warning:</b> the Lego Adelphi has not been designed to comply with building regulations. There have been no surveys.
    The HSE has not<br/>  been consulted or even informed (and as far as we know they are completely unaware of the existence
    of the Lego Adelphi).
